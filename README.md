# Stock Options Intelligence

AI-powered trading intelligence engine using real-time SPY data, machine learning, and Claude reasoning to predict short-term option moves with entry, target, and stop-loss levels.

## Features

- Real-time SPY options data ingestion
- ML-powered price movement predictions
- Claude AI reasoning and analysis
- Actionable trading signals with entry/target/stop-loss levels
- Risk management and position sizing
- Comprehensive backtesting framework
- RESTful API with FastAPI
- Docker containerization
- Prometheus monitoring and Grafana dashboards

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- API Keys:
  - Anthropic Claude API key
  - Market data provider API key (Polygon.io or similar)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pallab06/stock-options-intelligence.git
cd stock-options-intelligence

# Run the setup script
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/setup.sh

# Or manually:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start supporting services (PostgreSQL, Redis)
docker-compose up -d postgres redis

# Run the application
python main.py

# Or run everything with Docker
docker-compose up
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Root endpoint
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /api/v1/signals` - Get trading signals
- `GET /api/v1/backtest` - Run backtests
- `GET /api/v1/models` - Model performance metrics
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics
